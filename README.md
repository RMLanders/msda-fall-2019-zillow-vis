This project is for use by the Fall 2019 DA 6233 Zillow data group.

To clone this project on your local repo, you will first need to download Git.  Git is a version control.  This means that it allows a group of people to work collaboratively on projects by keeping track of changes, allowing users to contribute to projects without stepping on each others' toes, allowing users to revert to changes if a recent change caused a bug, and a whole other multitude of stuff.  This will help us as we are creating new data files or updating R code.  

For Mac, download here: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
For Windows, download here: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Next, unless you're comfortable with the command line and would rather use that, download a Git GUI.  I'd suggest GitKraken, as that is what I'm using.

Download GitKraken here: https://www.gitkraken.com/download/windows64

Now, to clone this repo (to clone a repo means to store a project on your local computer), follow these steps:

1) Open GitKraken (or your GitGUI of choice)
2) Click on 'Clone a Repo'
3) In the field that says 'Where to clone to', choose a folder where the project (and all its files) will go.
4) In the field that says 'URL', paste this: https://github.com/RMLanders/msda-fall-2019-zillow-vis.git
5) Then click 'Clone the repo'

What appears is going to look scary and intimidating, don't let it fool you.  What it's doing is showing you the entire history of the project.  Every change that was made by a collaborator and pushed to the repo and when that change was made is shown by that weird subway-map looking graph in the center.
