Guidelines for DA6233 Project 
You will submit: 
1. All code (not applicable if you used only Tableau) 2. Datasets 3. Slides in Powerpoint, Keynote, or HTML (if used) 4. Tableau workbook (if used) 
All the above ﬁles should be zipped and submitted on Blackboard before 10:30 pm on 10/20 (i.e., the deadline is 2 days after the last class). 
The Zip ﬁle will have to be named as follows if you are from the day cohort: 
DA6233_2019_Day_Group##.zip 
Here Group## will be your group number. For example, Group number 1 will submit 
DA6233_2019_Day_Group01.zip 
Note the leading zero in the group number 
The Zip ﬁle will have to be named as follows if you are from the evening cohort: 
DA6233_2019_Evening_Group##.zip 
Here Group## will be your group number. For example, Group number 1 will submit 
DA6233_2019_Evening_Group01.zip 
Note the leading zero in the group number Presentation  In the Day cohort, every group gets 20 minutes for the presentation. Out of these, 15 minutes are for the actual presentation and up to 5 minutes for Q&A. 
In the Evening cohort, every group gets 15 minutes for the presentation. Out of these, 10 minutes are for the actual presentation and up to 5 minutes for Q&A. We will strictly stick to these time limits. 
In order to stick to your 15 minutes, please rehearse your presentation with all the group mates at least once.

Grading guidelines for the project 
The project will be graded on the following 5 criteria: 
1. Are the insights interesting? (35% weight) 
Interesting insights are deﬁned as the insights that: • Are non intuitive • Might change knowledge and/or behavior of a lot of people at least marginally OR might change knowledge and/or behavior of a few people substantially • Are actionable 
2. Evidence of hard work/exploration on insight discovery (15% weight) 
This is somewhat related to the ﬁrst point because unless you do a lot of exploration, it’s diﬃcult to ﬁnd interesting insights. However, a lot of exploration may not lead to interesting insights. In case your insights are not interesting, I will deﬁnitely give you credit if you provide evidence of signiﬁcant exploration. This could be in the form of all the plots or Shiny apps you made. It could also be in the form of Tableau dashboards you built during the exploration stage. 
3. Quality of the visualization (20% weight) 
Good visualizations will have several properties that we have been learning during the course: • Easy to interpret. There is one message per visualization. • Easy to read. No clutter, no small fonts, no obscure fonts, right color palettes to increase the contrast, etc. • Right type of visualization. For example, if you have zip codes, use spatial visualization such as maps.  • Interactivity only when necessary. A lot of times interactive visualizations may hide information by making the dashboard too complex for the stated purpose. Choose interactivity carefully. 
4.  Quality of the presentation (15% weight) 
I will look for the following: • Did you stick to the time limit? • Was your presentation energetic? In other words, were you interested in your own presentation? • Did you face the audience as opposed to looking at the screen (on into the abyss!)? • Did the transition from one group member to another went smoothly?

• Did you handle the questions from the audience well? 
5.  Peer evaluation (15% weight) 
Peer evaluation will be based on the evaluation from your group (10%) and evaluation from the classmates (5%). I am still working out the mechanics of actually getting this feedback into the system
